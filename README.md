# SimpleIPScan

I wanted to scan my network to discover the devices on my network associated with IP addresses. 

I could have easily found a free IP scanner but I wanted to create one that fits my needs.

It is very basic, where it runs through the desired range (start to end) and displays the status of the IP address.
